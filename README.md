This library contains all the code I used to create the visual effects for my Halloween story, [THE LAST REUNION SHOW](https://neathobby.com/special/the-last-reunion-show/). The effects are done with `<canvas>` HTML elements overlaid on top of the page images.

## Basic Setup

To add the visual effects library to your webpage, copy the `dist` folder over to where your webpage is, then add the following `<script>` element at the bottom of your page, right before the closing `</body>` element:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="./dist/main.js"></script>
```
