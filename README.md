This library contains all the code I used to create the visual effects for my Halloween story, THE LAST REUNION SHOW. The effects are done with `<canvas>` HTML elements overlaid on top of the page images.

You don't have to understand progamming to use this library. If you know how to write some basic HTML code for a webpage, you can use this library to apply the same kind of visual effects to your own comics.

## Basic Setup

To add the visual effects library to your webpage, copy the `dist` folder over to where your webpage is, then add the following `<script>` element at the bottom of your page, right before the closing `</body>` element:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="./dist/main.js"></script>
```
